Standards 802.1D-2004 and 802.1Q-2003

Authors:    Juan Luis Manas (juan.manas@integrasys.es)

Based on code by Alessandro Rubini and Tomasz Wlostowski.

Short info: Loadable module in kernel space, which handles UFIFO IRQs (RTU IRQ 
            registration, capture and handling).



This module applies gnurabbit (http://www.ohwr.org) misc device concepts to 
make RTU UFIFO interrupts available to user space. It depends on the "wrminic" 
and "wrvic" drivers developed by Alessandro Rubini at his wr-switch-software 
project (git://gnudd.com/wr-switch-software.git).

It also depends on the definitions made in wrsw_rtu_wb.h.

For compilation and installation instructions, read the README file in the
"wrsw_rtud" package (placed at software/wrsw_rtud).
